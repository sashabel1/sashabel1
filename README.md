✨ A little more about me...

👩‍💼 I have been mentoring high school girls in programming for **two years through the QUEEN B program**, teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping them develop both skills and confidence.  
📚 I also guide 10th-grade students at **Magshimim**, teaching them C programming and supporting their learning journey.  
💡 I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and combining creativity with logic in both projects and teaching.
