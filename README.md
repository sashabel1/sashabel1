✨ A little more about me...

👩‍💼 I have been mentoring high school girls in programming for **two years through the QUEEN B program**, teaching HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, helping them develop both skills and confidence.  
📚 I also guide 10th-grade students at **Magshimim**, teaching them C programming and supporting their learning journey.  
💡 I enjoy solving complex problems, learning new technologies, and combining creativity with logic in both projects and teaching.

### 🚀 My Projects

#### 🛡️ [BESAFE](https://https://github.com/sashabel1/BeSafe-Hackathon)
**AI-Powered Safe Browsing & Social Network (Hackathon Project)**
A comprehensive solution aimed at protecting users from offensive online content. 
* **Chrome Extension:** Actively scans web pages using AI to detect harmful content. Upon detection, it triggers a supportive chatbot offering four actionable options: Emergency contacts, talking to a supportive bot, transitioning to our safe social network, and parental notifications (future development).
* **Secure Social Network:** A dedicated platform featuring strict AI-based content filtering. Harmful direct messages are automatically blocked from being sent, and the platform enforces a "3-strikes" ban system for users attempting to post offensive content.

#### ⏳ [HistoryFlow](https://github.com/sashabel1/HistoryFlow)
**Dynamic AI Timeline Generator**
An interactive web application that dynamically generates visual historical timelines by integrating AI, Wikipedia, and the Unsplash API.
* **Core Feature:** Users input a topic, and the system automatically constructs a rich, chronological timeline.
* **Explore & Discover:** Features pre-built timelines based on curated datasets, an "On This Day" integration, and the ability to drill down into specific sub-topics directly from an existing timeline.
* **In Development:** A custom builder for users to create and manage their own personal timelines.
